    <p>I confess that there is little to like about Google&rsquo;s Blogger platform.
It certainly has not kept pace with offerings like Wordpress or Medium.
I suspect that it would suffice for normal text only blogging, but
I have a technical blog and getting code snippets to work well is painful.</p>

<p>So when I learned recently that Github Pages supported Jekyll I
immediately did a search to see if Hugo supported Github Pages.
To my delight it did. Furthermore, since blogging is often a
&ldquo;sofa&rdquo; activity, I decided to try to use my Chromebook from the start.
I have a Samsung Chromebook Plus, which uses an ARM chip and often
means a little more work. I have crouton installed using the target
&ldquo;cli-extra&rdquo;, which means no GUI&hellip; just Vim and me (1).</p>

<p>First I tried to just use apt-get to install Hugo, but that version
is over two years old and couldn&rsquo;t even do the quickstart tutorial (2).
So I used the tarball instructions to install
<code>hugo_0.38.2_Linux-ARM64.tar.gz</code>.
I installed as directed into <code>$HOME/bin</code> and ensured that it was
on my path. Transcript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/hugo_0.38.2_Linux-ARM64.tar.gz 
README.md
LICENSE.md
hugo
$ ./hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.38.2 linux/arm64 BuildDate: <span style="color:#ae81ff">2018</span>-04-09T08:17:45Z
$ which hugo
/home/cecil/bin/hugo</code></pre></div>
<p>I found out quickly that when I started the hugo web server
to view my content, I was able to simply switch tabs and go to
<code>localhost:1313</code> to view&hellip; and it worked perfectly.
If unable view the content, then using my Chromebook
was pretty much a non-starter.</p>

<p>There are several ways to setup Hugo to work with Github Pages (3).
Since I wanted to be able to have multiple blogs, I settled on
the &ldquo;project&rdquo; based approach.</p>

<p>By far the hardest part of using Hugo is picking a theme (4).
There is a wide variety of themes, which is a good thing.
But the themes have little consistency and support a bewildering
set of parameters and features, which makes it hard.
I soon learned to look at the list of configuration parameters
in the theme documentation to evaluate whether a theme had what I wanted.</p>

<p>I finally settled on the Kiera theme
(as a fan of Vlad, how could I resist??).
It is simple, clean, and rendered my test post very well,
which included code blocks, backticked phrases, bullets, images, links,  etc.
However, it did not support Google Plus as a social network option,
which I wanted.
So I had to research a bit and ended up forking the theme
and doing a pull request to add it.</p>

<p>In the hours I played with different themes,
I finally got into a rhythm on evaluating them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new directory for the theme
(if tried to keep multiple themes in one project, the configuration
parameters seemed to interfere, so I kept them cleanly separated)</li>
<li>Copy over content, static folders</li>
<li>Use the theme&rsquo;s <code>config.toml</code> file as a starting point and update it to suit</li>
<li>Finally start the server and test it: <code>hugo server -D</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Since these are static web pages, there is no built-in commenting system.
Disqus is available, but has mixed reviews. So I simply suggest that
if you want to comment, contact me over on LinkedIn or Google+ (see top
of each post)&hellip; or file an issue in Github! :-)</p>

<p>My first set of posts will be ones ported over from Blogger.</p>
